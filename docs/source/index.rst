Welcome to the beeSpaces API documentation!
===========================================

.. sectionauthor:: Bruno Leupi <bruno@bee365.ch>

**beeSpaces** is a service for provisioning Teams and SharePoint environments
according to a companies needs using `PnP-Provisioning-Templates <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/pnp-provisioning-tenant-templates/>`_
and other interfaces.

By default a handy :term:`Wizard` is available on the target SharePoint environment. However, sometimes
a deeper integration into the company automation processes is required and a direct usage of the service
via API preferred.

Check out the :doc:`/architecture` section to get a rough overview of the involved systems
and the :doc:`/usage` for a brief description of the API covering most use cases.
